                <p>Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 â€“ 22 December 1989) was an Irish novelist, playwright, short
                    story writer, theatre director, poet, and literary translator who lived in Paris for most of his
                    adult life. He wrote in both English and French.</p>
                <p>Beckett believed writing in French forced him to be more disciplined and to use the language more
                    wisely.</p>
                <p>After writing a study of Marcel Proust, he came to the conclusion that habit and routine were the
                    "cancer of time", so he gave up his post at Trinity College and set out on a nomadic journey across
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Beckett made his way through Ireland, France, England, and Germany, all the while writing poems and
                    stories and doing odd jobs to get by. In the course of his journeys, he came into contact with many
                    tramps and wanderers, and these aquaintances would later translate into some of his finest
                    characters.</p>
                <p>Beckett finally settled down in Paris in 1937. Shortly thereafter, he was stabbed in the street by a
                    man who had approached him asking for money. He would learn later, in the hospital, that he had a
                    perforated lung. After his recovery, he went to visit his assailant in prison. When asked why he had
                    attacked Beckett, the prisoner replied "Je ne sais pas, Monsieur".</p>
                <p>Beckett's dramatic works do not rely on the traditional elements of drama. He trades in plot,
                    characterization, final solution, which had hitherto been the hallmarks of drama, for a series of
                    concrete stage images. Language is useless, for he creates a mythical universe peopled by lonely
                    creatures who struggle vainly to express the unexpressable. His characters exist in a dreamlike
                    vacuum, overcome by an overwhelming sense of bewilderment and grief, grotesquely attempting some
                    form of communication, then crawling on, endlessly.</p>
